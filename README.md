### Setting up our environment
---
We create a new virtual environment with:
`python3 -m venv venv`
and we can now check with `ls` the newly created environment.

In order to activate our environment we run:
`source venv/bin/activate`

and now we can for example install packages with pip, like:
`pip install -r ./requirements.txt`

If we want to exit the virtual environment we just run `deactivate`.
